### 📘 **Cloud Computing – Logical Clock Synchronization Summary**

---

### 🧠 **Why Logical Clocks?**

* **Lamport (1978)**: Perfect time sync isn't always necessary.
* Key idea: In many distributed system (DS) scenarios, it’s **enough to maintain the correct event order**.
* **Example**: In an e-commerce cart, it doesn’t matter if `Add TV` happened at 3:01 PM and `Remove TV` at 3:02 PM. What matters is: **Remove came after Add**.

---

### ⌛ **Logical Clocks vs Physical Clocks**

* **Physical clocks**: Measure actual time (real clock time).
* **Logical clocks**: Maintain event **ordering**, not actual time.

---

### 🕹️ **Types of Logical Clocks**

1. **Lamport’s Clock**
2. **Vector Clock**

---

## 🔢 **1. Lamport’s Logical Clock**

#### 🧩 Goal:

To ensure all processes **agree on the order** of events.

---

### 📏 The “Happened-Before” Relation (→)

Defined using three rules:

1. **Same process**: If A occurs before B, then A → B.
2. **Message send/receive**: If A sends and B receives, then A → B.
3. **Transitivity**: If A → B and B → C, then A → C.

---

### 🔄 **Lamport’s Clock Algorithm**

* Each process keeps a **counter**:

  1. **Local events**: Increment the counter by 1.
  2. **Send event**: Attach the current counter value.
  3. **Receive event**: Set counter = `max(local, received) + 1`.

---

### 🧪 Example:

Let `T1`, `T2`, `T3`, and `T4` be logical timestamps:

* Message `m1` sent at T1 with clock 5.
* Receiver’s clock = 3 → updates to `max(3,5)+1 = 6`.

#### ⚠️ Caveat:

* Lamport clocks **do not detect concurrency**.
* Different events may have same timestamps.
* Order is **partial**, not full causality.

---

## 🧮 **2. Vector Clocks**

#### 🔎 Goal:

Capture **causal relationships** (A happened before B) and **concurrent events**.

---

### 📚 How it works:

* Each process has a **vector of N entries** (for N processes).
* Example: In a 3-process system, P1's vector might look like: `[2, 1, 0]`.

---

### 🔄 **Update Rules**

1. **Internal event**: Increment only that process’s entry.
2. **Send message**: Increment own entry, attach full vector.
3. **Receive message**:
   * Increment own entry.
   * Set vector = `max(local, received vector)`.
4. Example:
  * P1=[1,0,0] -> (internal event) -> P1=[2,0,0]
  * P1 sends to P2: P1=[3,0,0]
  * P2 receives: P2[3,1,0]

---

### ✅ **Causality Detection**

* **A → B** (A happened before B) if:

  * Every element in A ≤ B, and **at least one** is strictly less.
* **Concurrent** events:

  * Neither A ≤ B nor B ≤ A.

---

### 🧪 Example:

* A: `[2,1,0]`
* B: `[2,2,0]` → A → B
* A: `[2,2,0]`
* B: `[1,3,2]` → A and B are **concurrent**

| Tracks Causality        | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                                   |
| Data Structure          | Single integer per process | Vector of integers (one per process)    |
| Can Detect Concurrency? | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                                   |

### ✅ **Final Notes**

* **Lamport's Clock**: Simpler; good for basic ordering.
* **Vector Clock**: More powerful; required when causal relationships and concurrency detection are important.
